PRO-C239: SECURE CODE REVIEW

The causes for the SQL Injection are:--
  The SQL language is not too secure to build a program because its security can be overpassed by writing a part of code that satisfies the requirements of the SQL query.
How could you avoid it?
  We can overcome it by using SQLAlchemy which works in the following way:--
    The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python. 
    It has several distinct areas of functionality which can be used individually or combined.
    SQLAlchemy provides a small secure code to build strong programs.

The causes for the IDOR Attack are:--
  The IDOR Attack can be performed by ticking the URL. since in program code the request is asked from the URL itself
How could you avoid it?
  We can avoid it by making a session in our code so that one direct request can be made from the URL itself.

The cause for the Authorisation Issue on the Profile page:--
  This issue is because the Profile page is designed using SQL which can easily be bypassed using specific values.
How could you avoid it?
  We can use another language other than SQL

The cause of the Phishing attack and how could you avoid it?
  It occurs due to the uploading of unauthorized files on the sites which can be stopped by specifying a few valid extensions for the uploading of the files.

Identify and write a different way of solving any of the above or any other vulnerabilities that were not discussed in the class.

Ways to prevent coloning of webpages/websites.
  We can use an iframe to design our Web pages.
